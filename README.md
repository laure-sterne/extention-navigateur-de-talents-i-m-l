## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

This project taught me the structure of a web extension and the manipulation of the DOM. It was also a challenge because the goal of our project was too high for the remaining time. 

Thanks to this sprint of two weeks, I learned to manage my frustration since we weren't able to complete our project. I was also able to learn how to better manage the organization of a team by setting up daily points.
